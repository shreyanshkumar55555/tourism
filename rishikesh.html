    <p>Rishikesh, also spelt as Hrishikesh, is a city near Dehradun in the Indian state Uttarakhand. The northern part of Rishikesh is in the Dehradun district while the southern part is in the Tehri Garhwal district. It is situated on the right bank of the Ganges River and is a pilgrimage town for Hindus, with ancient sages and saints meditating there in search of higher knowledge. There are numerous temples and ashrams built along the banks of the river.

        It is known as the "Gateway to the Garhwal Himalayas" and "Yoga Capital of the World". The city has hosted the annual International Yoga Festival on the first week of March since 1999.Rishikesh is a vegetarian-only and alcohol-free city.
